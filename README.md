# Aquilegia
Aquilegia is a pure Javascript application to serve a set of documentation.<br> 
As it don't use any server side language or configuration, it can be used on simple embedded servers.<br>
It is using a simple wiki markup set for pages linking and overall site structure, but this is not a wiki (no online editor).<br>
Yet adapted for a documentation below 50 pages, there is some possibilities of scaling up.<br>
While initially developped as an help system for a web application, it expanded to be used as an on board documentation server
for a 3D printer board, the Duet.<br>It can be integrated in an application without interfering.<br>   
Not modular, but relatively complete without any add-on or configuration.<br> 
Presentation site is here : http://aquilegia.blue<br>
Demonstration site at http://otocoup.com/DWC2  (link is case sensitive) - The documentation of the Duet and its firmware.<br> 
It needs Jquery core (version 2.2.1) <br>
Code size is 47 kB, compile to 20 kB with Closure compiler (not zipped), but you shall add Jquery core 83KB and 8 kB css<br>
